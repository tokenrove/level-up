	<dt><h2>What is this site, and why does it exist?</h2></dt>
	<dd><p>The fundamental idea behind Level Up! was to make life
    more like videogames, and to try and harness some of the simple
    but powerful feedback that classic role-playing games use to keep
	    a player going.</p></dd>
	<dt><b>Can't I just add arbitrary XP?  Is that
      cheating?</b></dt>
	<dd>The only person you can cheat is yourself,
      since the purpose of Level Up! is self-motivation and
      productivity.  There is the Hall of Heroes, but it's mostly for
      fun.  Players who appear to be abusing things just to get on the
      Hall will simply not appear on the Hall, at the discretion of
      the administrators.</dd>

	<dt><b>You made me read this page just for that?</b></dt>
	<dd>Actually, there will be more content here soon.  I want to
	expand on the philosophy behind this application, so people
	  will understand why it exists and where it's going.  But I'm busy adding features.</dd>
